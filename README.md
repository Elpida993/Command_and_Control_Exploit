# Command_and_Control_Exploit
This is malware that is written in python. The idea is that once its installed on the victims machine it will look for a text file from a server and execute whatever command is in the file. 
DO NOT USE THIS ON SOMEONE WITHOUT THEIR PERMISSION. that wouldnt be very nice :(
